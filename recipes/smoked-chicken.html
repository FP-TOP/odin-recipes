    <p>These smoked chicken legs are so versatile and easy! I like to use applewood chips or other fruit woods, but maple is also a great choice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        </li>
